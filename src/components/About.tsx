      <p>
        I have gained a solid base as a programmer during my bachelorâ€™s degree
        studies in Information Technology and since he has worked as a Logistics
        Coordinator at Posti. In earlier 2023, I started programming actively
        focusing on UX/UI before delving deeper into programming at Integrify. I
        have also completed a certificate in the Finnish language.
